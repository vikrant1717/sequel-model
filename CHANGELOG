* Changed dependency to sequel_core.

* Removed examples from sequel core.

* Additional specs. We're now at 100% coverage.

* Refactored hooks code. Hooks are now inheritable, and can be defined by supplying a block or a method name, or by overriding the hook instance method. Hook chains can now be broken by returning false (#111, #112).

=== 0.1 (2007-12-30)

* Moved model code from sequel into separate model sub-project.
